GRADE ASPECTS
	50% work with Adam on specalutive exceution
	50% exam

	[+] maybe can talk with them in the personal forum
	about opening me the 30 mins after class questionir


STUDENTS LECTURE ASPECTS
5 last lectures are of students
story about 2 papers from the subject
30 - 40 mins of a lecture
	[+] should get the dates and update Omer about them
	[+] should talk with Adam about the dates and close with the lectures the date and the subject and 2 papers

OVERFLOWS AND MALICIOUS CODE EXECUTION
	stack
	stack overflow (e.g. the web func using sprintf)
	memory endianness
	overflow mitigation (W^X pages on linux DEP on windows)
	ROP (especially Intel 'cause variable length instructions, ROP generator)
	ROP mitigations (ASLR)
	address memory leaks of current process
	ROP mitigations (compiler that avoid 0xC3 bytes aka RET, shadow stack)
